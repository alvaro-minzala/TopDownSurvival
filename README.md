# Top Down Survival
As the name suggests, this is a Top Down Survival game. It's a multiplayer game
so you need friends to play. Art work inspired by [Zombs.io](https://zombs.io)

This game also uses [Godotcord](https://github.com/Drachenfrucht1/godotcord) to integrate Discord's GameSDK. If you're only going to export the game on your own, you can use the pre-built export templates provided in `Top Down Survival/bin/export_templates`. However, if you're going to make modifications to the game you'll have to rebuild the Godot editor with the Godotcord editor module.

## How to run the game?
The game is made with Godot Engine, so you need to install that to play it
(or you can just download the prebuilt binaries in the releases section).

**NOTE:** Please do not use local IP addresses to connect to a server (usually
starting with `192.168`). However, if you're hosting the client and server on
the same machine, connecting to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) will work.
